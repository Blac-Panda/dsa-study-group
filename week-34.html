            <li>Week 2's Topic is On Hash Tables & Hash Sets</li>
            <li>There's a small subsection in CTCI about Hash tables (Pg 99)
            </li>
            <li>
                Another good resource is this
                <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/"
                    target="_blank">link</a>

            <li>
                Hash tables are super useful and can often be a neat trick for reducing the runtime of many algos
            </li>
            <li>
                They offer O(1) inserts and delete. They can also be used to find duplicates, keeping track of stuff
                we've seen previosly during an iteration etc
            </li>
            <li>
                Good practice involves attempting to write a hash table from scratch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hash sets are similar to hash tables with the difference being that they just have values. Hash tables
                have key & value pairs.
                Sets are usually more appropriate when we don't need to keep track of a key-value mapping and we just
                need the value (or the key)
            </li>
            <li>
                Question Of The Week - What is a collision in hash tables and how can we work around them?
